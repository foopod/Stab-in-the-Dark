Explore a world where the only way you can perceive your environment is through audio queues.

Stab in the Dark is a first person shooter game for the visually impared. The brain child of [ScreamingHawk][] and [foo][], Stab in the Dark offered a chance to play with [Unity][] and create a multiplayer, multi-platform game with an emphasis on sound. With the lack of visual cues, you have to rely on your sense of sound to navigate the map, avoid environmental hazards and find your opponents.

### In Game
In the game, your goal is to kill the other players by stabbing them. To do this you have to use your sense of sound to navigate the map, avoid hazards and find your opponents. 

Use WASD to move around the level and Left click to slash with your knife. You can also taunt your opponent by clicking the mouse wheel. 

As opponents join or respawn, you will hear the woop sound. 

### Levels
There are a number of levels available for play in Stab in the Dark, each with their own hazards and play style. 

##### Bunker
The original map, Bunker, is a T shaped room with a large window looking out of a beautiful sea view. There is a leaky pipe at the bottom of the T. There is a small forest at on end of the T's cross and a fire pit in the top corner of the other side of the T's cross. 

This map was primarily used for testing purposes. 

##### Fire Pit
Fire Pit is a square room with a leaky pipe in the center. The room has four fire pits equally spaced around the room. There is a small forest of trees in each corner. 

The number of fire pits in this map promotes a stealthy play style with minimal movement.
