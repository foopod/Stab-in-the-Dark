# Stab-in-the-Dark

The game where you can't see. Explore a world where the only way you can perceive your environment is through audio queues.

This is a game that in theory you could play almost anywhere, who needs a monitor when you have headphones? 

##Todo
- Create a debug mode to show raycasts/walls/objects.
- Make a GameMenu scene that, then load other scenes from that.
- Start using Master Server for networking so you dont need to worry about IP addresses.
- Fix Network player identification so it doesn't use IP addresses.
- Possibly Redo networking entirely so that server handles everything.
